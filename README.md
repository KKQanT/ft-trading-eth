# S3T Trade Contract (Ethereum)

## Overview
This project documents my transition from Solana to Ethereum development by migrating my own marketplace platform ([ft-trading](https://github.com/KKQanT/ft-trading)) to the Ethereum blockchain. As a former Solana developer, I built the original project implementing a token trading platform with an on-chain dividend system. Now, I'm using this migration process to learn and understand Ethereum's development patterns and best practices.

## My Original Project Features (on Solana)
In my Solana implementation, I built:
- Token trading functionality with escrow system
- On-chain dividend distribution system
- NFT-based shareholding mechanism
- Automated fee collection and distribution


## Project Structure
I'm breaking down my learning journey into several lessons:
- Lesson 1: ERC20 Token Implementation
- Lesson 1.5: NFT (ERC721) Implementation
- Lesson 2: Escrow System (Coming Soon)
- Lesson 3: Dividend Distribution System (Coming Soon)

## Technical Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Hardhat (Development Framework)
- OpenZeppelin (Smart Contract Libraries)
- Ethers.js (Ethereum Interaction)

## Development Status
ðŸš§ Currently working on this project as I learn Ethereum development.

## Background
This project represents my journey transitioning from Solana to Ethereum development. The original [ft-trading](https://github.com/KKQanT/ft-trading) was my implementation on Solana, and through this project, I'm exploring how to achieve similar functionality within Ethereum's ecosystem.
